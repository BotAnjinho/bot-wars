Animated Player who can be moved using on-screen bidirectional controller, jump & shoot buttons.\r\n1. Animated Enemies which are spawned using object groups in TMX maps.\r\n1. Player can shoot multiple bullets and kill enemies.\r\n1. Enemies jump towards the player (attack) when player is in close proximity.\r\n1. Multiplayer over internet (3G/WiFi) and Bluetooth in a co-operative style.\r\n1. Uses tiled maps with TMX map format for building levels.\r\n1. Object layers in the TMX maps are used to define collision areas and enemy spawn points.\r\n1. A static image is used as background layer.\r\n1. MultiTouch Pinch Zoom gesture enabled for supported devices.\r\n1. The interface includes a Splash Screen, Main Menu, Settings Menu for changing a few parameters, a Map Menu with image previews of levels, dialogs for selecting and displaying bluetooth devices and connecting to a device over internet or bluetooth.\r\n1. Hardware independent, works on any android device with an ARM CPU and dedicated GPU.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\n\r\n* [BotWars.java](https://github.com/dipenpradhan/bot-wars/blob/master/src/botwars/main/BotWars.java)\r\n\r\nThe main game activity, containing all code for game mechanics, loading maps, images, sounds required for the game, essentially the whole game, can be run independently without other classes\r\n\r\n* [BotWars_MultiPlayer.java](https://github.com/dipenpradhan/bot-wars/blob/master/src/botwars/main/BotWars_MultiPlayer.java)\r\n\r\nThe superclass for MultiPlayer, inherits from BotWars.java, and adds support for MultiPlayer, responsible for adding player 2 and handling messages. It contains sendMessage() and receiveMessage() stub methods\r\n\r\n* [MultiPlayer_UDP.java](https://github.com/dipenpradhan/bot-wars/blob/master/src/botwars/main/MultiPlayer_UDP.java)\r\n\r\nThe class responsible for MultiPlayer over internet, inherits from BotWars_MultiPlayer.java and adds methods for receiving and sending MultiPlayer Messages using UDP packets\r\n\r\n* [MultiPlayer_BT.java](https://github.com/dipenpradhan/bot-wars/blob/master/src/botwars/main/MultiPlayer_BT.java)\r\n\r\nThe class responsible for MultiPlayer over Bluetooth, inherits from BotWars_MultiPlayer.java and adds methods for receiving and sending MultiPlayer Messages using BluetoothSockets (obtained from MapMenu_BT.java)\r\n\r\n* [StartMenu.java](https://github.com/dipenpradhan/bot-wars/blob/master/src/botwars/main/StartMenu.java)\r\n* [MenuTextTouchListener.java](https://github.com/dipenpradhan/bot-wars/blob/master/src/botwars/main/StartMenu.java)\r\n\r\nMain menu and touchlistener for the text, uses xml layouts from /res/layout folder\r\n\r\n* [SplashScreen.java](https://github.com/dipenpradhan/bot-wars/blob/master/src/botwars/main/SplashScreen.java)\r\n\r\nThe splash screen shown when game is launched\r\n\r\n* [MapMenu.java](https://github.com/dipenpradhan/bot-wars/blob/master/src/botwars/main/MapMenu.java)\r\n\r\nA menu for selecting levels/maps with image preview for all maps\r\n\r\n* [MapMenu_UDP.java](https://github.com/dipenpradhan/bot-wars/blob/master/src/botwars/main/MapMenu_UDP.java)\r\n\r\nInherits from MapMenu.java, and adds dialog to enter IP for playing over internet\r\n\r\n* [MapMenu_BT.java](https://github.com/dipenpradhan/bot-wars/blob/master/src/botwars/main/MapMenu_BT.java)\r\n[DeviceListActivity.java](https://github.com/dipenpradhan/bot-wars/blob/master/src/botwars/main/DeviceListActivity.java)\r\n\r\nInherits from MapMenu.java and adds required code for retrieving nearby bluetooth devices and establishing an RFCOMM socket to another device, this socket is handed to Multiplayer_BT.java for sending/receiving MultiPlayer Messages.\r\n\r\n* [SettingsMenu.java](https://github.com/dipenpradhan/bot-wars/blob/master/src/botwars/main/SettingsMenu.java)\r\n\r\nMenu for changing a few game parameters\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Other Info\r\n\r\n* The game mechanics use AndEngine libraries along with the Box2D physics extension \r\n\r\n* The Multiplayer feature is based on a custom message passing protocol with UDP packets and message passing over Bluetooth sockets. \r\n\r\n* In multiplayer, movement of all players and all enemies is calculated locally on each phone, messages contain ONLY direction of player movement, stop, jump, and shoot\r\n* A location update is sent every 2 seconds to ensure player and enemy positions do not vary by a large margin and both players see each other, and enemies at the same location on map\r\n* A force kill message is sent to kill enemies such that both players have same enemies on screen even with network delay \r\n* Note: Port 5000 is used for communication, gameplay over internet requires port 5000 to be forwarded to device IP\r\n\r\n* The interface uses android specific APIs, XML layouts and styles \r\n\r\n* Images and sprites used for characters are from freely available examples, tilesets for maps are taken from Replica Island-a free, open source game. \r\n\r\n* Will work on all android devices, may run slow on devices with HVGA screens and <1Ghz processor","tagline":"A 2D multiplayer game for android devices, built using AndEngine and Box2D","google":"UA-32478840-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
